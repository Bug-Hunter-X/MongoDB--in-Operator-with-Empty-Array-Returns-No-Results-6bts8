# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB queries involving the `$in` operator with an empty array.  The incorrect usage leads to unexpected behavior, always returning an empty result set regardless of data existence. The solution illustrates how to handle this scenario appropriately.

## Bug Description

The `$in` operator is designed to check if a field's value is present within a provided array. When an empty array is used as the input, the query always fails, producing an empty result set.  This behavior is counterintuitive and can lead to unexpected application logic errors.

## Solution

The correct approach involves handling the scenario where the input array is empty.  Instead of directly using the empty array in the `$in` operator, we must implement conditional logic to adapt the query based on the array's content.
